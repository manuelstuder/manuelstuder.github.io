👋 I am an entrepreneurial-minded tech enthusiast with a background in computer science and a specialization in machine intelligence. Currently, I serve as a Data Product Manager, overseeing the complete lifecycle of data products—from discovery to implementation. In this role, I collaborate closely with data engineers and developers to ensure seamless and efficient product development.

📚 During my studies in computer science at ETH Zurich & Stanford University, I cultivated a deep understanding of theoretical concepts and their practical applications in the real world. My curiosity led me to specialize in machine learning.

💭 Beyond academics, I have been actively engaged as a teaching assistant, research assistant, and had the honor to serve as the President at ETH Entrepreneur Club - a student organization fostering entrepreneurship and empowering the next generation of entrepreneurs.

🏃 I am a sports fanatic with a passion for pushing my limits. Over the years, I have competed in a full-distance IRONMAN and several (ultra) marathons.
